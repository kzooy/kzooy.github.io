<css_group>
the perfection deck or the ocd/py-gang deck its a deck about useing more than 1 attack then 1 per turn useing mew and mewtwo GX tagteam (wow, thats a long name)
<br> <br>
</css_group>

<!-- main -->

how it works: <br>

so as active you'll need a damage soacker like V-max meowth (he's got  300-330 heatl) it also uses mew and mewtwo GX tagteam. its ability "perfection" lets you use an attack of benched GX/EX attack. and how it works <br> <br>

abilitys can be used in bench, so put a strong GX (wiht a great GX attack) and mew and mewtwo (i aint' saying the full name) to use its ability <br> <br>

how to use it: <br>

put your damage soaker in active (of course) put your strong GX in bench and mew and mewthree too. before attacking with your damage soacker use perfection with your strong GX on the GX attack. this lets you do infinite (well, as much mew and mewtwo's in your bench) GX moves.
